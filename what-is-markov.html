    <h1>What Is A Markov Chain?</h1>
    <img class="content-image" src="images/markov_chain.png"></img>
    <p>A Markov Chain is a method of diagramming outcomes determined by chance. For example, on
        any given day, the weather can either remain sunny or turn rainy; this is a two-element
        Markov Chain. Other elements, such as wind or snow (heaven forbid), can be added as well,
        but the probability of each occuring decreases with every additional outcome.</p>
    <p>Markov Chains can be written like so:</p>
    <code>[[0.5,0.5],[0.5,0.5]]</code>
    <p>Above is an example of a 2-element Markov Chain, where every outcome (Point 1 remains at
        Point 1 or moves to Point 2, and vice versa) has a 50% chance of occuring. </p>

    <p>Markov chains can be used to generate text by making one element for
        every word. The markov chain used in our website is a markov chain with
        an order of two, meaning it not only considers the previous word but the
        word before that when picking the next word.</p>
